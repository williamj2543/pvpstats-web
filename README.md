pvpstats-web
============

A simple web frontend for pvpstats (a bukkit plugin).

A modified preview can be seen at: http://cardinalcraft.net/stats

NOTE: Every version after v1 (found in releases) most likely requires a modified version of the plugin. 
The modified source can be found here: https://github.com/paul1338/PVPStats
Please keep in mind that if you don't use the modified plugin for any commits after v1 that it might fail.

Install:
============
Edit the config/config.php and input your information. 

Then it should work. :D
